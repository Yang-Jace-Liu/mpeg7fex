How to Compile the Library and the Test program that uses the library to extract features from images.

Steps:

0. Install OpenCV 3.1.0 (I compiled the library with this release of OpenCV now).


Compiling the Library:
1. First open the zip archive.
2. Open the CodeBlocks project file MPEG7FexLib.cbp
3. Go to Project > Build options > "Search directories" tab > Compiler
   Change the opencv include directory according to your installation.
   On my computer it is /home/research/libs/opencv-3.1.0/include
   On your computer it should be different
4. Go to Project > Properties > "Build targets" tab
    Change the output filename to MPEG7Fex.lib 
    Since I use Linux, it is libMPEG7FexLib.a; on Windows, static libs end in .lib
5. Compile the project. It should compile and generate the library  MPEG7Fex.lib under the lib directory

Compiling the test code under the "test" directory (it uses the library to extract features from the images).
1. Go to the "test" directory
2. Open the CodeBlocks project file MPEG7LibTest.cbp
3. Go to Go to Project > Properties > "Build targets" tab
    Change the output filename to MPEG7Test.exe  (or any other name, xyz.exe your program's name)
4. Go to Project > Build options > "Search directories" tab > Compiler
   Change the opencv "include" directory according to your installation (as above)
   On my computer it is /home/research/libs/opencv-3.1.0/include
   On your computer it should be different

   Change the opencv "lib" directory directory according to your installation
   On my computer it is /home/research/libs/opencv-3.1.0/lib
   On your computer it should be different
  
   go to "linker settings" tab
   Change the link libraries according to your computer.
   For example, change "MPEG7FexLib" to "MPEG7Fex.lib" (this is the library you compiled above)
   For the other opencv libraries, check the opencv "lib" directory and find the correct filenames and modify them
5. Compile the project and obtain the MPEG7Test.exe (or whatever name you gave your program above, in step 3)
6. Run the program
   If you run it from CodeBlocks, it will compute some of the descriptors on the 'motor.jpg' image in the test directory.
   If you run it from the command line and give it a new image, it will work on that image:
   MPEG7Test.exe image.jpg
