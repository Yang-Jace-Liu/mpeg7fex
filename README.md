MPEG-7 Feature Extraction Library

MPEG-7 Feature Extraction Library : This library is adapted from MPEG-7 XM Reference Software to make it work with Open Source Computer Vision library (OpenCV) data structures (e.g., Mat). It has a very easy-to-use API. Moreover, existing bugs (resulting in wrong descriptor values) in XM software are corrected.

Supported MPEG-7 Descriptors : (Extraction from whole images supported)
Color Structure Descriptor (CSD)
Scalable Color Descriptor (SCD)
Color Layout Descriptor (CLD)
Dominant Color Descriptor (DCD)
Homogeneous Texture Descriptor (HTD)
Edge Histogram Descriptor (EHD)
